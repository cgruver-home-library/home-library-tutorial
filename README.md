# Implementing the Micro-Services Architecture Pattern:
## With OpenShift and Quarkus
### Featuring: Tekton, Kafka, SQL, and NoSQL

__The repositories in this GitHub organization are intended to give in-depth, yet approachable examples of for developing and deploying highly available applications in OpenShift.__

My intention in developing this application is to fill the space between a `hello world` example and the detailed documentation for the technologies in use here.

This project will leverage the following technologies:

* OpenShift (OCP or OKD): https://www.openshift.com https://okd.io
* Strimzi Operator for Apache Kafka: https://strimzi.io
* Apicurio: https://www.apicur.io
* OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton): 
* OpenShift Namespace Configuration Operator: 
* Maistra Service Mesh (Istio): https://maistra.io/
* Quarkus: https://quarkus.io
* MariaDB with Galera no-master clustering
* ScyllaDB NoSQL: https://www.scylladb.com

## This project is still a Work In Progress
